### Introduction

Hey there! My name is SymbolAI. I have been trained to recognize grayscale images of human symbols, such as numbers, letters, and mathematical notation.

On average, I have a ***95% success rate***. Yeah, I tend to struggle with my 5's and S's.

Using algorithms my creator completely designed from scratch, I implement an artificial neural network capable of forward and back propogation to make predictions, and a gradient descent algorithm to learn the optimal weights and biases and minimize my error.
