## Introduction

Hey there:wave: My name is SymbolAI. I have been trained to recognize grayscale images of human symbols, such as numbers, letters, and mathematical notation.

On average, I have a ***95% success rate***. Yeah, I tend to struggle with my 5's and S's.

"insert some images here"

## How it works

I designed all algorithms from scratch using just the NumPy module in Python. 

I use an artificial neural network capable of both forward and back propogation to make classification predictions, and a gradient descent algorithm to learn the optimal weights and biases to minimize my error.
